						The last film I watched was "Blue Exorcist" on Netflix, partly because of a unappealing selection of alternate choices that
						was left when searching for TV shows other than Ghost in the shell. The premise of the film includes the protagonist who happens to be the spawn of satan, 
						who is tied to an ancient legend/story about a demon that eats peoples memories. As part of his job as a demon exorcist, Rin Okumura encounters a demonic ghost train that ravages the city 
						- tasked with its destruction, Rin accidentally releases the sealed demon of legend during a mishap that causes the ghost train to derail.

						<b>Review:</b> wasn't really too interested in the anime, but it did pique my interest in investigating the tv series which was better than I expected.

						The last film that I visited a cinema to view was Dr Strange, a marvel film that draws from the comic series(although I am not too familar with the comic inspiration). Includes the protagonist Stephen Strange;
						a respected and particularly arrogant surgeon involved in a car crash. In an attempt to repair his hands Stephen Strange takes a journey to visit the "famed" Kamar-Taj, after being accepted into the community
						he begins to learn that the secrets of life are much greater than just his scientific knowledge; with new found knowledge he begins his journey to become "Dr Strange", a master-in-training in the mystic arts.

						<b>Review:</b> Impressive graphics, particularly enjoyed Tilda Swinton's role as "the ancient" (despite the gender differencing that occurs between comic and film).
