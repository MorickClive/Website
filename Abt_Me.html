					<h3>Description:</h3>
					<p id = "fullborder" class = "tab1">
						This is an about page that is supposed to be about "me", though I doubt it'll be given much consideration.
						
						Asking any IT professional to talk about themselves is humourous in it's own right, I would probably consider myself
						to be the same in that respect. To put it into a nice basic format I suppose I'd just describe myself with a list of
						inconsquential bullet points; because you know, everyone can be summed up with bullet points right?

						Profile 
						As an individual who prides himself in honour and responsibility I strive to complete projects and goals to the highest quality. I utilise technology to organise and simplify tasks that can easily stray towards tangents. 
						Being part of a professional working team is often a difficult experience to achieve or capture. Working in QA Consulting has given me the skills to work effectively in a team to achieve abstract goals.
						Experience
						QA Consulting – Consultant, July 2017
						Agile Scrum
						My time with QA Consulting included training in team projects using the Agile software development technique. Understanding the challenges faced and providing a structured approach and solution are hugely important aspects of my work approach. Reaching a requirement or end goal in its absolute entirety is always a goal I strive towards. 
						Working in a team can provide challenges and tangents which can off track development, I always attempt to hone in on the immediate issues to steer the team toward to right direction. I consider myself a confident speaker who strives to convey meaning above bland presentations that detract from the message that needs to be delivered.
						JavaSE
						Covering Java again in addition to my own knowledge skills has given me a firm strength in system design; I’m a confident programmer with multiple languages in my skills set. 
						Part of the training really captured the relation between planning a system and the implementation of a particular system, being able to cover all requirements of a desired system can often leave room for errors, but I ensure any systems I create are tested thoroughly for flexibility and functionality.
						Github and source code control has always been important parts of working in a team. I now have confidence that I’d be able to share and modify important code/software without hindering other team members, but also be able to create my own extensions of the system that can be implemented/finalised after company review.
						SQL
						Although familiar with the principles of SQL, my training with QA has provided me with a rigid understanding and scope of the language. I no longer worry myself over the gaps in my knowledge since university and have a confident grasp of practical application with writing queries and managing database systems that origin from the language. 
						Automated Testing
						The use of JUnit for testing application in java is a skill set that has bolstered my capabilities in stress testing software elements, combined with Selenium to interact with live websites, I can write automated processes that report on software status and reflect on software stability. Being able to automate processes with the ability to hook into login systems can also allow me to automate tasks from database systems that can increase business productivity and efficiency.
						Continuous Integration

						-	Vagrant, Jenkins(server), Jira(git hookin).
						YMCA (community centre) – (2007)
						I worked on marketing material for the YMCA community centre in Hirwaun.
						As part of work experience in high school designed a poster to attract readers and the local community to part-take in enrichment activities.
						Skills
						Technical skills
						•	Programming	•	Data Processing
						•	Shader languages	•	Networking
